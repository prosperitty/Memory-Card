# Memory Card (League Of Legends)

A memory game using the react framework and League of Legends champion art assets.

## Overview

This memory card project is a simple memory game. The objective of this game is to obtain as many points as possible by simply clicking an image. However, if the player clicks a card more than once, the game resets and the player may attempt another round. 

The theme of this project is a MOBA video game named, League Of Legends. This project is not affiliated with League of Legends and is a parody project created personally for fun.

## Features

A scoreboard is displayed in the game which shows the player's score and best score. The score is incremented when the player has a clicked an image. The score is reset to 0 when an image is clicked more than once. The best score is updated when the player beats their highest score achieved.

After each click, the cards are shuffled to make the game experience challenging. 

The images displayed are characters(champions) from the League Of Legends game.
